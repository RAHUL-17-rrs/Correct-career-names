As part of a survey aimed at understanding students' career aspirations, you've gathered
responses from students about their career dreams, but there's a hitchâ€”loads of spelling
mistakes! For instance, "DOCTOR" is misspelled as "DACTAR" or "DOCTER," and

goof-ups. I developed an algorithm that can automatically correct these and makes
your form submission free from any spelling mistakes.
I used jaccard Similarity algorithm to device the solution and then plot the final data in a graph using matplotlib
